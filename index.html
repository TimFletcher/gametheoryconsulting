                The goal of Game Theory Consulting is to be a vendor and product agnostic sales
                organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Contrary to what some IT solutions providers will tell you, nobody is an expert at
                everything. Every organization wants to improve and solve either internal or
                external issues but unfortunately they usually don't know that a solution exists
                that solves their problem or they do not have the time to do the research to find
                the best solution for their organization.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most business will pick the solutions that they last heard about or the one referred
                to them this usually results in a partial solutions and the customer being somewhat
                dissatisfied. Game Theory Consulting sales approach is to learn about our clients
                discover what is their biggest organizational issue is that they need solved and the
                find the people or vendor to solve that problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some organizations may not have a clear picture of their biggest issue in such cases
                we can bring in either a management consultant or a business analyst to help them
                identify their issues. Once we have identified the client issue or need we will work
                with our vendor network to identify the best possible solutions to meet that
                client's needs. When we have narrowed down possible solutions each vendor will make
                a proposal and a presentation to the client we will assist the client in the
                decision making process by acting as a neutral third party advisor.
